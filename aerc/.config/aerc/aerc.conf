# Specifies the command to be used to tab-complete email addresses. Any
# occurrence of "%s" in the address-book-cmd will be replaced with what the

#
# The command must output the completions to standard output, one completion
# per line. Each line must be tab-delimited, with an email address occurring as
# the first field. Only the email address field is required. The second field,
# if present, will be treated as the contact name. Additional fields are
# ignored.

# This parameter can also be set per account in accounts.conf.

# Example:
# no-attachment-warning=^[^>]*attach(ed|ment)
#

[filters]
#
# Filters allow you to pipe an email body through a shell command to render
# certain emails differently, e.g. highlighting them with ANSI escape codes.
#
# The commands are invoked with sh -c. The following folders are appended to
# the system $PATH to allow referencing filters from their name only:
#
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/aerc/filters
#   ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/aerc/filters
#   $PREFIX/share/aerc/filters
#   /usr/share/aerc/filters
#
# The following variables are defined in the filter command environment:
#
#   AERC_MIME_TYPE      the part MIME type/subtype
#   AERC_FILENAME       the attachment filename (if any)
#
# The first filter which matches the email's mimetype will be used, so order
# them from most to least specific.
#
# You can also match on non-mimetypes, by prefixing with the header to match
# against (non-case-sensitive) and a comma, e.g. subject,text will match a
# subject which contains "text". Use header,~regex to match against a regex.
#

[openers]
#
# Openers allow you to specify the command to use for the :open action on a
# per-MIME-type basis.
#
# {} is expanded as the temporary filename to be opened. If it is not
# encountered in the command, the temporary filename will be appened to the end
# of the command.
#
# Examples:
# text/html=surf -dfgms
# text/plain=gvim {} +125
# message/rfc822=thunderbird

[triggers]
#
# Triggers specify commands to execute when certain events occur.
#
# Example:
# new-email=exec notify-send "New email from %n" "%s"

#
# Executed when a new email arrives in the selected folder
new-email=
